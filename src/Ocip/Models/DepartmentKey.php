/**
 * DepartmentKey
 *
 * Uniquely identifies a department system-wide.
 *         Departments are contained in either an enterprise or a group. Enterprise departments can be
 *         used by any or all groups within the enterprise. Department names are unique within a group and
 *         within an enterprise, but the same department name can exist in 2 different groups or in both
 *         a group and its parent enterprise. Therefore, to uniquely identify a department, we must know
 *         the department name and which enterprise or group contains the department.
 *         This type is extended by group and enterprise department keys.
 *
 * @Groups [{"id":"c0d21ef9ba207c335d8347e5172fce1d:2050","type":"sequence"}]
