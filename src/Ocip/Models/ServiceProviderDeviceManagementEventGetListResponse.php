 *         "Pushed/ Same Hash/ Not Pushed", "Login Id", "Start Time", 
 *         "Process Time".
 *         "Event Id" is a unique identifer for the event.

 *           Device Profile: "Device Name" "Service Provider Id" "Group Id"
 *           Device Type: "Device Type Name"
 *           Device Type Group: "Service Provider Id" "Group Id" "Device Type Name"
 *           Group: "Service Provider Id" "Group Id"
 *           User: "User Id"
 *         "Is Local" is set to "yes" if the event is processed on the server 
 *         who received the request, "no" otherwise meaning that the event is
 *         processed on another server.
 *         "Completion %" provides an estimate of the completion of the event.
 *         A percentage is given, the current number of completed expanded event,
 *         and the total number of expanded event.
 *         "Pushed/ Same Hash/ Not Pushed" gives the total number of files that 
 *         were pushed, not pushed because of same hash, and not pushed when 
 *         processing the event.
 *         "LoginId" is the user or admin id who triggered the event.
 *         "Start Time" is the date when the event was started.  The display 
 *         shows the month, days, hours, and minutes (MM-dd hh:mm).
 *         "Process Time" is the time taken to process the event in hours,
 *         minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (hhhh:mm:ss.SSS).
 *         Each row represents an event sorted by priority of processing.  The 
 *         first row in the table is an event that has an associated expanded 
 *         event currently being processed or next in line to be processed.
